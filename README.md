# DungeonMastersJava

**A Text Based RPG which...**

+ Takes commands from user (ex. use potion, go north)
+ Validates these commands
+ Uses if statements for command validation
+ Has a currency system which utilizes arithmetic operations
+ Utilizes arrays for monster generation
+ Utilize loops for navigating through dungeon/shop/etc.
+ The User will be an object with properties (HP, strength, gold, etc.)
+ Will be able to write save data to an external file (containing current HP, total HP, gold, items, dungeon progress, etc.)

**Stretch Goals:**

+ Be able to read save data so that you never lose you progress
+ Save data files with an MD5 checksum to ensure that the user did not edit their save file
+ Has dungeon randomization
+ Have NPCs that the user can communicate with
+ Have quests that the user can recieve from NPCs, so that the user is not just traversing dungeons for gold
+ Create a tutorial quest to introduce the functionality of the game (If the user has a save file, this would be skipped)
